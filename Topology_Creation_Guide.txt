Title: How to Create a Network Topology from a Project Scenario

---
STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE:

1. READ & ANALYZE THE SCENARIO
   - Identify departments, users, services, and locations.
   - Look for performance, security, or redundancy requirements.
   - Example: “Finance and HR must be isolated, but both access internal servers.”

2. DEFINE SCOPE & OBJECTIVES
   - Specify what you’re designing: LAN, WAN, Data Center, or full enterprise.
   - Set project boundaries (you’re not building the internet).

3. BREAK DOWN THE NETWORK LAYERS
   - Core: Main routing backbone.
   - Distribution: Policy and inter-VLAN routing.
   - Access: End-user connections.
   - Edge/DMZ: Firewalls, internet access, VPNs.

4. MAP REQUIREMENTS TO TECHNOLOGIES
   - Department isolation → VLANs + ACLs or ZBFW.
   - Secure remote access → VPN or DMVPN.
   - Routing efficiency → OSPF, EIGRP.
   - Redundancy → HSRP/VRRP, EtherChannel.

5. DESIGN THE LOGICAL TOPOLOGY
   - Decide which devices connect logically (routers, switches, firewalls, servers).
   - Keep zones clearly separated: Inside, DMZ, Outside.

6. DESIGN THE PHYSICAL TOPOLOGY
   - Determine actual interfaces and connections.
   - Use clean naming conventions (R1, SW1, FW1, etc.).

7. PLAN IP ADDRESSES & VLANs
   - Create an IP scheme with subnets per department or site.
   - Label VLANs: VLAN10-HR, VLAN20-Finance, VLAN30-Servers.

8. SELECT ROUTING & SECURITY PROTOCOLS
   - Routing: EIGRP, or OSPF depending on scale.
   - Security: ACLs, Zone-Based Firewall, IPS, NAT.
   
9. IMPLEMENT AND TEST
   - Simulate in Packet Tracer or EVE-NG.
   - Ping across zones, test ACLs, failover, and routing convergence.

10. DOCUMENT & PRESENT
   - Diagram with clear labels.
   - IP plan and protocol summary.
   - Explain why each design choice was made.

PRACTICAL TIPS:
- Keep your topology modular — easy to expand.
- Don’t mix routing protocols without redistribution planning.
- Use color-coded zones (Inside, DMZ, Outside) for clarity.
- Always verify reachability and security behavior.
- Save configurations at every stage.
